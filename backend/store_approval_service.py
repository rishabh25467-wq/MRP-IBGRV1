"""Requester -> Store Approval workflow (Aug 2026).

When the auto-release pre-flight stock check (production_confirmation_
service.check_component_availability) finds one or more BOM components
short at the target site, the create-and-release job no longer just fails
the whole run. Instead it still creates the SAP Production Proposal right
away (per user's explicit choice - "create proposals in SAP immediately"),
then pauses and opens a `store_requests` doc so a warehouse/store user can
record what was ACTUALLY issued via the unauthenticated `/storeapproval`
screen before the automated Proposal -> Order pipeline (server.py's
`_continue_order_creation`) is allowed to resume.

Lifecycle: pending -> resolved (store had enough, or store chose to
proceed with a partial issue) OR pending -> partial_pending_planner (store
issued less than required and asked the requester/planner to decide) ->
resolved (planner approved) or cancelled (planner rejected).

No SAP "delete proposal" step exists for `cancelled` - confirmed via
research that SAP ByDesign's ManageProductionProposalIn only exposes
CreateBundle, no Cancel/Delete operation. A cancelled request simply never
triggers the Release action, so the Proposal sits un-converted in SAP -
the exact same harmless/documented outcome as any other Proposal a
planner chooses not to act on."""

# genuine SAP-side transient network errors (this tenant has documented
# intermittent connect timeouts under load elsewhere in this app) -
# SAPGoodsMovementError has no HTTP-status attribute like the old

    Aug 2026, user's explicit business rule: the Goods Movement is ALWAYS
    Raw Material -> Semi-Finished Goods at the request's own site - no
    picking a source warehouse or typing a target bin anymore (that manual
    picker from the previous iteration is gone). `_rm_warehouse`/

    against real inventory data, e.g. "P2/P2-RM" -> "P2/P2-SFG"). Site
    itself is not yet locked to the logged-in user (planned, not built -
    user's words: "will be fixed later") - for now it's whatever site the
    original shortage request was raised for.

    The Owner Party ID can't be picked either now - it's read off whichever
    of the component's own `locations` sits in the RM warehouse (SAP's real
    stock owner for that exact bin, "RI"/"RT"). If the component has no

    a hard block on the approval itself.
